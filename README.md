# Project 0 - GitHub Basics

The repository that was created when you accepted the assignment has 4 files in it that are part of this assignment. There are two programs and three problems to fix.

## Java
`HelloWorld.java` should print the text "hello world" to standard output. There are two errors that need to be fixed in this program to make it compile and work to the documented specification.

## JavaScript/HTML
`helloWorld.html` and `helloWorld.js` should display the text "hello world" in an alert box. There is one error that need to be fixed in this program. To run the program, simply open the HTML file in your browser.

## You need to do the following:

* Create a branch and name it something meaningful
* Correct the mistakes in each program (they are all small, silly things...)
* Document your changes both in the code with comments and in the README.md
* Document which tool you used to work with git (command line, GitKraken, GitHub's own GUI tool, etc.) in the README.md
* Commit and push your branch back to GitHub
* Create a pull request with comments to merge the branch
* Merge the branch back into `master`
* Don't delete your branch (or anything else with the process). We will be checking these!
